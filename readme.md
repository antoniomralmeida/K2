## Project K2 is a scientific research and innovation project that aims to build an expert system that uses technological resources of artificial intelligence, as well as other advanced computing techniques. The purpose of this system is to support the work of an expert in making tactical and operational decisions, when the expert resource is expensive and difficult to obtain and retain, or when the work involves having to make several complex decisions in a very short time or when the specialist's work environment is unhealthy.


### GOAL of K2 Project
A knowledge-based system (KBS) is a type of computer system that analyzes knowledge, data and other information from sources to generate new knowledge. It uses AI concepts to solve problems, which may be useful for assisting with human learning and making decisions. These systems often have built-in problem-solving capabilities that allow them to understand the context of the data that they review and process and make informed decisions based on the knowledge that they store.

Build an open source KBS, to be real-time expert system development platform for building mission critical process control, alarm management, and complex simulation applications

### K2 BK System can be used in various workspaces, such as:
1. Manage industrial plants autonomously (PLCs)
2. Reduce setup time for industrial lines
3. Manage call centers or service management
4. Autonomously define customer credit limit
5. Autonomously set prices for products and services
6. Telemedicine, with complementary medical diagnosis
7. Military use in the control of launching rockets and missiles, guided
8. In risk management of any nature, including environmental
